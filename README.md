# machine-learning-stuff
This repository contains code that was realised for training with the FreeCodeCamp course about [Machine Learning with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/). 
The code in this repository is structured in folders representing each one a challenge to pass that course:
- `linear_regression_healthcare`: challenge about healthcare costs prediction using linear regression algorithm.
